Dependency in programming is an approach where a class uses specific functionalities of another class.

## Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences

      ## Advantages
      Reusability of code(Classes)
     
      Branded cloud storage devices, which are sold by reputed companies, come with enhanced data security features. All that you need is
      an Internet connection for taking online backup comfortably as and when required.

      Ease of code refactoring

      Ease of testing

     ## Disadvantages
     Dependency Injection makes it difficult to trace the code as the developer needs to refer to more files to understand how the system behaves.

     Dependency Injection allows loose coupling, it ends up increasing the number of Interfaces & classes.
