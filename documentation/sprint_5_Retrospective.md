### sprint velocity

velocity = totalStoriesSp - storiesLeftSp
         = 30 - 19
= 11

## Retrospect

### challenges

1. Time estimations for the stories were off. They reflected the most optimistic time but not based on the skills of the team.
1. Taking the whole sprint to finish relatively low estimated stories.  

### Challenges mitigation plan

1. Give developers an extra day as courtesy to finish the story
1. Continuously presenting the solution and how far a developer has went daily

### Things to continue doing

1. plan user and developer stories together
1. continue knowledge sharing and helping each other.
1. Group memebers regularly push their stories on github
1. continue submitting sprints every seven days
1. Base our sprint planning on previous sprint velocity
1. Communication about progress of story.
1. Assigning stories that are related to a particular member.

### For the next sprint we are aiming for a velocity of 14
