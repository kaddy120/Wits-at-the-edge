Total number of stories done = 8
stories not done = 3

### sprint velocity

velocity = totalStoriesSp - storiesLeftSp
         = 40 - 8
= 32

## Retrospect

### challenges

1. Time estimations for the stories were off. They reflected the most optimistic time but not based on the skills of the team.
1. Taking the whole sprint to finish relatively low estimated stories.  
1. Wasting time doing the wrong thing.

### Challenges mitigation plan

1. Estimate story points using fibonacci
1. Continuously asking questions and getting feedback

### Things to continue doing

1. plan user and developer stories together
1. continue knowledge sharing and helping each other.
1. Group memebers regularly push their stories on github
1. continue submitting sprints every seven days
1. Base our sprint planning on previous sprint velocity
1. Communication about progress of story.
1. Assigning stories that are related to a particular member.

### For the next sprint we are aiming for a velocity of 40
